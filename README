Tips (Bukkit Plugin)

Tips is a simple plug-in for the Minecraft mod
server Bukkit.

It allows a server administrator to define short messages (tips) that are periodically displayed to players via chat. 

This is a good way to remind players about server rules, and provide other helpful information, even when you are not logged in to the server.
